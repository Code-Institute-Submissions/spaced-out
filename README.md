## User Experience
- For the design aspect of this game I wanted the user to be involved from the start and have commands to enter the game. 

- The game starts with a countdown before tne user may enter their name and read the game instructions before starting. 

- Once the game starts, the first question will appear to the user and a set of options, in which the player can select one as the correct answer.
